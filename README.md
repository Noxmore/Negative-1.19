# About
My own custom Minecraft version to mess around in, i can't publish the actual source code cuz i'm using Mcp-Reborn, so this is just where i'll just post downloads for it.

# How to install
Although these versions should work in the Minecraft launcher, i'm only offically supporting Multimc.

To install:
 - Make sure you have Multimc installed. (https://multimc.org/)
 - To download, go to https://github.com/Noxmore/Negative-1.19/releases/latest/ and scroll down, then download "Minecraft.1.19.(number).jar".
 - Create a new 1.19 Multimc instance.
 - Click "Edit Instance"
 - In the "Version" tab, click "Add to Minecraft.jar" and select the jar file you just downloaded.
 - Launch and enjoy!
